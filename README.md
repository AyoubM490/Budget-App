## `Database creation`

```

## `Tests`

### Running specs:
Default: Run all spec files (i.e., those matching spec/**/*_spec.rb):
```
$ bundle exec rspec
```
Run all spec files in a single directory (recursively):
```
$ bundle exec rspec spec/models
```
Run a single spec file:
```
$ bundle exec rspec spec/models/user_spec.rb
```

Run a single example from a spec file (by line number):
```
$ bundle exec rspec spec/models/user_spec.rb:8
```

See all options for running specs:
```
$ bundle exec rspec --help
```

### rails tests:
